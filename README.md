# HytaleTempHPBarLVL (Script Mod)

This repository is a **build-free** Hytale Script mod that shows a custom HP bar HUD, displays player level, and optionally greets players when they join.

## Structure

```
HytaleTempHPBarLVL/
├── mod.json
└── scripts/
    └── main.hscript
```

## Install

1. Copy the entire folder into your Hytale server's `mods/` directory.
2. Start the server. The script will load automatically from `mod.json`.

## Customize

Open `scripts/main.hscript` to tweak:
- UI placement and colors.
- How the HP and level values are displayed.
- The welcome message shown on player join.
